# ChatGPT-Review-Analyzer
This program uses the ChatGPT API to analyze reviews.

**Important information:**
The pricing for using the ChatGPT API can be found here: https://openai.com/pricing

Reviews will be given a predicted rating, analysis, and predicted tags.

Two files will be written to, one with all of the above, the other with a list of all the tags across the reviews, sorted from most occurring to least.

Your reviews should have a full blank line between each review.
